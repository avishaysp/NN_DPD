%Uses the CALC subsystem. This system does internal calculations on the data set include statistics and limit checking.
%1)Take 20 readings and turn on internal limits. Set limit and check the questions status byte if a reading was outside of limits.
%2)Then perform math functions including mean, max, min, standard deviation, and peak to peak. The max and min reading will show the readings that were outside of the limits
