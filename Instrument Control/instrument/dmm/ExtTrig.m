%This example sets the DMM up in the Ext trig mode. This mode waits for a signal to come in on the Ext Trig connector then starts a measurement.
%It will setup a trigger count of 5 triggers. This means that one the DMM is in the wait for trigger state, it will accept 5 trigger signals before returning
%to the idle trigger state.

% This example requires an external signal connected to the 'Ext Trig in' connector. The signal should provide a TTL positive going signal to the DMM.
% If the signal is not provided the program will encounter an exception with an error message 'Unexpected I/O data termination'
