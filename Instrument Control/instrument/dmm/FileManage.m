%  /*Four use cases using the MMEM subsystem. This subsystem contains the SCPI file management commands that can be used to create/copy/paste files.
%          * 1) Takes 10 readings. Then stores the data from reading memory and copies it to a file on the internal DMM drive. It then shows how to copy
%          * that data over to the host PC.
%          * 2) Takes the current state of the DMM then saves the preference and state into files on the internal DMM drive. It then resets the DMM and recalls
%          * the state and preference files to bring back the previous state of the DMM
%          * 3) we transfer files from the PC to the DMM internal drive and the USB stick (if there is a USB stick installed)
%          * 4) Erase all the files that were created.
