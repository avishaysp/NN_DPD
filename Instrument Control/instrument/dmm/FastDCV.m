%In this example program we try to configure the DMM for the fastest DCV readings. To do this, we turn off autorange, null, and auto zero settings.
% We also set the the DMM to its fastest reading rate, examples using NPLC or resolution are shown.
% Finally, we optimize the throughput from DMM to PC rate

% First clear any connections with instruments
newobjs = instrfind;
if isempty(newobjs) == 0

    %You can also set for minimum NPLC for fastest reading

    %1 NPLC = 1 power line cycle. Example 1 NPLC in US = 1/60Hz = 16.66 ms. 100NPLC = 1.6 seconds.
    %Using an NPLC setting has the added benefit of rejecting power line noise i.e. normal mode rejection.

    %Turn off Null
    fprintf(myDmm,'VOLT:DC:NULL:STAT OFF'); %There is a similar command for most functions including Temperature, Current, Resistance
    
    %The above commands will configure the fastest readings for the DMM. We can also optimize the data transfer rates to the PC by taking our set of readings
    %then transfer after the end of the readings.
